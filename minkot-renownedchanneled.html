          Minkot Renownedchanneled was the first and only dwarven High Queen of The Aqua Salve. She was crowned in the year 31 and ruled until her death in the year 67. She is remembered for leading the defense during The War of the Hammerers where her skill with the sword was tested in two great battles. In the Splattered Battles she struck down the serpentine Cirono Haildrink, and halted the enemies advance. In the Siege of Roars she bested the putrid blendec Unam Sulliedbraids, and though she later fell to Xosun Rankbeach, the defense succeeded in ending the siege. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In the year 10 she was abducted by the Squashed Works and taken to the forest retreat Elethathemu, known to the dwarves as Thundermodest. Over the years she gained the trust of the public and at the age of 12, in the year 15, became the tavern keeper of the Chestnut Snack. It became one of the few taverns outside the Dwarven Kingdom to have access to true dwarven alcohol. The Chestnut Snack quickly became famous and was frequented by nobility of The Aqua Salve and by the dwarves of the Cradled Citadel. This helped form a good relationship between the ferric elves and the dwarves.

          Never would she see her parents again. They settled in the fortress Mirrortunnel after she was abducted. Udib Trueorb, Minkot's father, won every wrestling and axe throwing competition held by the Cradled Citadel for over 100 years. Udib's final victory was one month before his death in the year 109. Vabok Constructhame, Minkot's mother, joined a small mercenary group and lived peacefully until her death in the year 87. Both Vabok and and Udib sought eternal life but failed to find the dark secrets needed to accomplish their goal.
        </p>
        <p> Killed in the Roasted Attack, as part of the Conflict of Ruining, the High Queen Redari Spokenwhipped's death created high tensions between the ferric elves and the putrid blendecs. Fears that attacks could come at any moment created a need for a strong and just ruler. The dwarves of the Cradled Citadel began to discuss trade deals, including access to finely made dwarven weapons. One year later Minkot Renownedchanneled was crowned High Queen and every forest retreat had magma forged, iron crossbows.

          Over the years of her rule, the people of the Aqua Salve became more protective. Over were the days of expansion, the Aqua Salve would never again see it's borders grow. By the year 33 it was only the bravest of traders willing to cross into the Aqua Salve lands. Rumours began to spread that it was not safe to travel the woods at night.
        </p>
        <p>
           Towards the end of her rule, it had seemed all the measures put into place had worked. The putrid blendec had never attacked and the people of the Aqua Salve had adapted to their new way of life. This changed however on the year 66 when the Mechanical Dungs attacked Joyous Plain beginning the War of Hammerers. Minkot led the defense against the putrid blendec until the final battle which took place in Splatteredzeals. Minkot Renownedchanneled fought bravely, defeating Unam Sulliedbraids in single combat. She was the last to fall that day and was struck down by Xosun Rankbeach. The battle ended and the Mechanical Dungs accepted an offer of peace from the Aqua Salve, ending the War of Hammerers. In the year 68 Wanala Tongscloistered became High Queen and continued Minkot's work of defending the people of the Aqua Salve.
